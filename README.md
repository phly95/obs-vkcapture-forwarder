## Forwarder for obs-vkcapture

Currently, this simply displays output from obs-vkcapture without OBS itself. Currently, it seems to be low latency. The goal of this is to integrate this into Deck-Upad to stream the second screen from various emulators like Azahar and perhaps others MelonDS and Cemu, but Azahar is the current focus.

Multi-region support is now added in preparation for gamescope oversized window support.
